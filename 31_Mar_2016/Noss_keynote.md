## Fire in the Southeast

- Focused on the Southeastern coastal plain
- ...and the 'evolutionary environment' of the region
- Importance of getting fire mgmt right; bad consequences 
  - _Diversity and Distributions_ Noss et al 2015, NA Coastal Plain as a global biodiversity hotspot
  - >1800 plant species; 85% dependent on fire
  - fire is controversial

### Importance of native Americans and fire

  - humans most likely to change fire regime if susceptible, but ignition limited
  - coastal plain is saturated with ignition (e.g., lightning)
  - i.e., although anthropogenic change in parts of NA, but not in coastal plain
  - some fine examples of assertions that are passed along (like high anthropogenic fire in central FL) without evidence
  - flora in coastal plain quite similar to flora of 45 MYA; interesting "cycling" between oak and pine during past 61K years
  - fauna too, such as RCWO back 100K years ago
  - some intersting patterns of areas of endemism, with foci on the coastal plain
  - see paper in Natural Areas Journal 2010 on fire tolerance of flora from coastal plain
  - see He et al. 2012, _New Phytologist_ for pine fire evolution
  - 55% of _Q. marilandica_ basal area is bark (_Ecosphere_ 2015)
  - Noss is suggesting that longleaf pine fast initial growth is an adaption to fire (get out of the flame zone)...hmmm...
  - many of these fire-adapted species may be characterized by niche construction, i.e., their phenotypes encourage more fire
  - FL GRSP doesn't breed successfully in areas with >24-month fire period

### Importance of fire seasonality (I think we've moved to this section)

  - data suggests fire interval very fast over most of 
  - Big Island Savannah, Green Swamp Preseve...up to 50 spp per 1m^2
    - requires annual burning to maintain the diversity
  - two kinds of fire exclusion
    - active (suppression)
    - passive (lanscape fragmentation stops runs)
  - in central FL, fires peak in May / June
  - see Platt et al. 2015 _PLoS Biology_ for a recent, detailed analysis of fire season
  - some evidence of greater fitness effects of growing-season  or lightning-season fire (see, e.g., FIll et al. 2012 _Ecosphere_)
  - nice photo of two adjacent sites burned 15d apart, with the later fire, after the start of the natural season, showing much stronger wiregrass response
  - there are some species that do not respond well to fire season
  - *ESA* issue: no fire season burns in FL GRSP habitat if occupied (unsurpising but disappointing)
  - winter fires are critical for keeping fires on the ground in the modern coastal plain

### Management implications

  - Frequency usually trumps seasonality, but not always
  - place the burden of proof on those who want to burn _outside_ of the fire season
  - maximum firediversity does not beget maximum biodiversity because that fire goal does not (necessarily) replicate evolutionarily important, natural fire regimes

## Questions
- several that I missed, but one about the effects on microrhizal fungi...not much known evolutionarily, some concern that fungi might be temporarily set back.
