# Pitcher's thistle PVA 

## NAME, ECU

_Background_

- PVAs; viability ~ 95% probability of persistence / 100 y
- the thistle
  - 4-8 y lifespan
  - no vegetative reproduction
- seed head weevil
  - T under ESA
  - new threat
  - introduced for control of invasive thistles
- resource dilution vs. concentration
  - hypothesized that the weevil would show dilution effect
  - preliminary data show heaviest damage at lowest thistle density

_Methods_

- field sampling from site near SBDNL
- using a stage-based matrix model
  - they have 18 matrices, but unclear the origin of these 18 models
  - her goal is to incorporate the resource dilution data to the model (good idea)

_Results_

- resource dilution increases the extinction horizon to ca. 30 y from 20 y using the flat 40% fitness reduction from weevils

_Conclusions_

- this is a good thing

_Questions_

- What are these new models (integral projection)? use continuous inputs
