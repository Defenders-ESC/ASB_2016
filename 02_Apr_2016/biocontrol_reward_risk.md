# Biological control: rewards and risks

## Jolls, ECU

_Background_

- biocontrol is a significant investment
- > 500 agents currently released
- Big question: Are biocontrol agents effective?
- how do biocontrols fail?
  - fail to spread
  - fail to read "damage densities"
  - removal != community recovery
  - solution becomes a problem
  - ???What about adaptation to biocontrols???

_Methods_

- use a BACI design or an enemy addition / removal experiment
- compare fitness of all spp in an experiment
- several "eye candy" examples
  - tropical soda apple ???

_Results_

- mean effect size was usually near 0 when analyzing rigorous experiments
- much smaller than previous studies suggest

_Conclusions_

- demographic principles are informative
- more needs to be done...
