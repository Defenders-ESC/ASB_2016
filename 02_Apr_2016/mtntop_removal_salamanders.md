# Mountaintop removal effects on stream salamanders

## Steven Price, E KY U

_Background_

- many human changes to environment
- mtntop removal
  - all the things you would think happen, happen
  - SMRCA! (I will work this into my talk, 1996 BiOp)
  - 250K ac. in KY since 1990
- Desmognathus!

_Methods_

- study sites in KY, with controls
- repeat counts in 10m reaches
- occupancy abundance models

_Results_

- 901 salamanders, 87 of which in mining areas
- much lower probability of occurrence in mining areas
- much, much lower abundance
- lower species richness (50% of control)
- sulfates 70x higher in treatment sites

_Conclusions_

- nothing going on here (joke!)...geeze this is bad
- what are the mechanisms
- not limited to stream salamanders!
