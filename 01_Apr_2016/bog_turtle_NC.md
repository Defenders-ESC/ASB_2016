_Background_

- including ESA listing in 1997
- not much known from the southern range at listing
  - her past work showed NC turtle survival lower than northern pops

_Methods_

- examined broad and small scale
- 11 study sites
- six measures of landscape cover
  - used NLCD
  - included several measures of road effects, including 
- linear regression as predictors of turtle densities

_Results_

- some sites with â‰¥ 100 sites, but most have fewer
- forest cover and wetland connectivity significant predictors of turtle density
  - had to remove an outlier to maintain significance

_Conclusions_

- importance of evaluating multiple scales
  - northern pops have 800m buffer, her results indicate larger buffer may be needed

_Questions_

- What's happening at Site A, which had the largest pops?  No idea...
