## Jessi Allen, NYBG

_Background_

- sea level rise already happening, going to get worse
- limited estimates of effects on biodiversity b/c of data limitations

_Objectives_

- quantify potential impacts
- ...

_Methods_

- Mid-Atlantic
- lichens!
- sampled 215 sites with > 13,000 vouchers
- get all data from NYBG lichen data from region; 
- final set of ~14,000 records of 193 spp
- SDMs with bioclim
  - > 10,000 models, AIC
  - convert to P/A

_Results_

- huge diversity in lowest area
- up to 34% loss in 6' sea level rise
- look at by function traits
  - larger distribution for sexual fungal spores
  - also sexual fungal spores most likely to be lost under sea level rise
- analysis by taxonomic group

\< I was paying 'too much' attention to the presentation and missed some notes! \>

Methods also very good here (as I expected from Jessi)
