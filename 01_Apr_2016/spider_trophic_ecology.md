# Spider trophic ecology

## Olivia Howell et al.

_Hypothesis_

I missed it...something about expecting a shift in trophic levels as habitats undergo succession

_Study species_

Three groups - web-builders, cursorial (e.g., wolf spiders), and harvestmen

_Study site_

- Old field around Washington & Lee Univ.; primary productivity
- Forest in Lexington, VA; primary productivity in the canopy

_Isotope analysis_

- Done @ VMI
- she offered an explanation of C:N ratios

_Results_

- In all cases, arachnids in old field are feeding at a higher trophic level than in forest
  - But the difference wasn't significant for web-builders
  - Forest arachnids probably feeding on detritivores
