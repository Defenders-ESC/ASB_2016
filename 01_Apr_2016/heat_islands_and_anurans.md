# Anurans in stormwater ponds in heat islands

## PERSON, PLACE

_Background_

- frogs, heat islands

_Question_

- how are calling and breeding affected by heat islands
- hypotheses: one for local, one for regional effects

_Methods_

- 66 ponds
- 6 surveys per year
- "fit all possible models" then cites Burnham and Anderson?
- used PRESENCE 

_Results_

- effect size only up to 0.35 (presumably SD), which doesn't seem very big.
- min temperature best predictor of species richness (I think that's what she said...)
  - high temp ~ lower richness
- detectabilty influenced by 

_Conclusions_

- increasing heat islands may decrease diveristy

----

I'm not sure if it's reasonable to ascribe causation of diversity decline to heat island effects...I suspect there are a lot of things going on...
