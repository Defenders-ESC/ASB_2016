## Michael Hooker, Western Carolina Univ.

Do Forest Service roads affect the dispersal of seeds? Are there differences between old and young (harvested < 15 y ago) forests? 

_Methods_

- Nantahala NF
- Five study sites
- Two transects per site (edge and interior)
- Six sample sites per transect
- Seed traps at each site, plus veg sampling

_Results_

- Difference between old and new?
  - sweet birch and {missed} showed difference in seed dispersal distance between young and old
  - younger sites with higher diversity
- Differences between old / new and edge / interior?
  - striped maple and american beech were different
