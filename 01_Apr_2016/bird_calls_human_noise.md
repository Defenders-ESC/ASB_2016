# Human ambient noise and bird vocalizations

## Anna Markey, Furman University

_Background_

- 

_Methods_

- recorders across a sound gradient
- five common species
- nine collection sites
- three treatments
  - human noise
  - river, etc noise
  - biological noise
- 405 recordings in all

_Results_

- NOCA and CARW min freq increased with noise
- no change in maximum frequency
- therefore, call compression but not shifts

_Questions_

- (me) Would this be selection or plasticity?  

----

Is this an undergrad project?
This is a good reason to include the original recording with iNat.
