# Habitat, urbanization, and forest birds

## Alexandra NAME, PLACE

_Background_

- habitat amount, configuration; matrix quailty
- unknown the relative importance of each of these three components

_Methods_

- study site is PA
  - 64% forest
  - 13M people...I think she said
  - good breeding bird atlas (5,000-block division, ca. 33,000 point counts)
- NLCD 2006 (this is the third talk using 2006 data...why?)
- used "clumpiness index" and "patch density" for configuration
- matrix quality: PCA of ubranization NLCD categories; similar for ag
- lm with AIC, all variable combinations
  - bird abundance, species richness, evenness, and AMRO and SCTA

_Results_

- bird abundance
    - amount of ag had the biggest effect, followed by ubranization
    - forest amount negligible
- richness
  - matrix quality had the top effect
- evenness
  - forest amount with greatest effect
- AMRO
  - urbanization and ag high
- SCTA
  - urbanization and forest amount high

_Conclusion_

- not amount of forest in most cases...matrix quality
- agriculture usually most important for matrix quality, but AMRO and SCTA

I think the methods for this work are among the best I've seen from this meeting
