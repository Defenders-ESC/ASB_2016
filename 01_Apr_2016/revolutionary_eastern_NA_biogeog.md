_Background_

- Land type evolution drives plant evolution
  - Not sure how this is revolutionary...
- Vicariance dates to Pleiocene to early Pleistocene
- see Harshberger 1911 
- "mechanism to link landscape change to community and species vicariance"
  - community vicariance?
- assumptions
  - some species date to the Pleiocene
- glacial relicts
  - southern hold-overs
  - northern expansion
  - hypsithermal expansion

- limestone glades
  - Decourt and Delcourt 1986 (southern movement)
  - Baskin and Baskin 1986 (in-place)
  - Edwards et al. 2004 (evaluation of preceding)

- he got to the Driftless area
- sandstone rockhouses
- "Riverscour Project"
  - He picked up _Conradina_ in this project...sand along river banks vs. coastal sand
  - Does his hypothesis make sense geologically

- _Croton alabamensis_ looks like a cool shrub that I want to find
  - pops in TX and TN
