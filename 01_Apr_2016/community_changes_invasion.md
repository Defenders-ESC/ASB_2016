# Biotic and abiotic changes with species invasions

## Dennis Tarasi (UNC Chapel-Hill)

_Study Species_

- privet
- autumn olive

_Study design_

- paired plot design
  - invaded by one species or the other
  - control sites at similar elevation, etc.
  - no invasive management
- 52 plots
- Carolina vegetation survey methods
- measure DBH
- HOBO light & temp, soil moisture

_How similar are control and treatment sites_

- binomial regression
- some autumn olive predictors: exchange capacity (?), K, Ca, Mg
- no privet predictors
- no statistically significant temperature, moisture differences

_Biotic impacts_

- no statistically significant differences in species-area curves
- privet invasion reduces alpha diversity, but not a huge amount
- invaded plots have significantly fewer small trees

_Conclusions_

- no significant differences in abiotic, but some native species effects (negative)
