# Better visual keys

## Bruce Kirchoff, UNCG

- Southeastern oaks
- Rather than showing a user single images, show groups of images where each image has similarities with other ins the group.
    - Ask user which group is more similar to their species
- Used crowsourcing to work on developing the key
  - AMZN Mechanical Turk 
  - expert elicitation
- based on the crowdsourcing result, build dendrogram
  - start with the novice-built key b/c they want it to be useful to novices
  - use expert dendrogram to refine the tree
- testing
  - use the Forest Service Key (made an online version) as the control
  - test both non-experts (plant diversity students) and experts
  - visual key increased ID accuracy 23% over Forest Service key (which was at 50%)
  - similar but slightly more extreme improvement for experts over FS key
- images are available on Flickr

**I want to see this key once they get it online...this seems like a good way to do keys in general.**
