# _Carex_ sect. _Acrocystis_ taxonomy and systematics

## Derick Poindexter, NC Botanical Garden

_Carex_

- 2000 spp in genus!
- 70 sections
- young genus
- holocentric centromeres encouraging chr breakage

_Acrocycstis_

- 45-47 spp
- holarctic distribution + Andes

_Objectives_

- Examine morphological variation
- Assess chromosome variation (will we get some karyotypes?)
- Phylogeny, phylogeography, ecology, etc.

_Methods_

- Specimens galore
- nextRAD for genomic sampling (using Illumina)
- karyotypes

_Results_

- >3800 polymorphic SNPs
- strong phylogeographic signal
- finding significant revisions are needed
- micro- and macro-morphological characters are concordant with the molecular tree

_Questions_

- How deal with partitions if catenating SNPs?  It's a problem...
