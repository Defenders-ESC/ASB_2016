# Functional traits of early successional species near forest openings

## Thom Green

_Background on seral_

_Questions_

- 
- variation in functional traits as a fx of distance from edge

_Methods_

- Nantahala NF
- 11 openings
- sampling both horizontal and vertical characteristics
- analysis
  - analysis linear regression on index (should be ordinal regression)
  - also some continuous vars

_Results_

- some basic characteristics of sites
- I think he's regressing on the mean values rather than using a nested model...
- shade tolerance drops with distance from edge (no surprise)
- tree wood density does not vary with distance
- vertical vegetation profile was as expected

_Notes_

- I think he needs to update the stats a good bit, even / especially if moving to multiple regression as he noted he wants to do
- Even after the talk I'm still unclear why this is important
