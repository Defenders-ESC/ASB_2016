# Spotted salamanders: juvenile choice of burrows

## Kathryn Greene, Davidson College

_Background_

- spotted salamander life stages
- threats discussion, e.g., mortality during dispersal

_Question / hypothesis_

- Interested in whether conspecifics affect juvenile behavior
- H0: Juveniles demonstrate avoidance to minimize potential agonistic interactions

_Methods_

- experiment with two burrows and two salamanders, Chi-sq (I suspect) test of distributions
- recorded trials and scored the recordings

_Results_

- most trials ended with cohabitation
- no statistically significant differences in behaviors scored

_Conclusion_

- distribution is clumped, perhaps trailing behavior
- juveniles have 23% mortality from anurans

_Questions_

- Any control of confounding factors?
  - chemical signals from previous trials, relatedness? No.
- What do they do in the field? Haven't looked.
